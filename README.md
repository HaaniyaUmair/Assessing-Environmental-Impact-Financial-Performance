# Assessing-Environmental-Impact-Financial-Performance
This project explores the relationship between companiesâ€™ environmental impact and their financial performance using a dataset of over 177,000 companies across diverse global industries. We conducted correlation analysis and multivariate regression, focusing on key financial metrics (e.g., return on assets, asset turnover, cash conversion rate) and environmental indicators (e.g., GHG emissions, water usage, total impact ratio). The analysis highlights sector-specific insights, addresses multicollinearity, and evaluates the implications of using estimated environmental data in financial modeling.
